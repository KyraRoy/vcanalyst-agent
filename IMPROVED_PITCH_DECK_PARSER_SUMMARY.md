### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

#### **Enhanced Text Extraction**
```python
def extract_text_from_page(page) -> str:
    """Extract text content using multiple methods"""
    # Method 1: Get text blocks (more structured)
    text_blocks = page.get_text("blocks")
    text_content = []
    
    for block in text_blocks:
        if block[6] == 0:  # Text block
            text_content.append(block[4])
    
    # Method 2: Get raw text as fallback
    raw_text = page.get_text("text").strip()
    
    # Combine both methods
    structured_text = "\n".join(text_content).strip()
    if structured_text:
        return structured_text
    else:
        return raw_text
```

#### **Improved OCR Processing**
```python
def extract_images_from_page(page) -> str:
    """Extract image content with enhanced OCR"""
    # Convert page to high-resolution image
    matrix = fitz.Matrix(2, 2)  # 2x zoom for better OCR
    pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=matrix)
    img = Image.frombytes("RGB", [pix.width, pix.height], pix.samples)
    
    # Perform OCR with better configuration
    custom_config = r'--oem 3 --psm 6'  # Use LSTM OCR Engine
    ocr_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, config=custom_config).strip()
    
    # Clean OCR text
    if ocr_text:
        ocr_text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\.\,\-\$\%\d]', ' ', ocr_text)
        ocr_text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', ocr_text).strip()
        return ocr_text
    else:
        return ""
```

#### **Structured Content Combination**
```python
def combine_slide_content(text_content: str, image_content: str, slide_number: int) -> str:
    """Combine text and image content into structured format"""
    # Extract potential slide title
    lines = text_content.split('\n')
    potential_title = ""
    if lines:
        potential_title = lines[0].strip()
        if len(potential_title) > 50:
            potential_title = ""
    
    # Build structured content
    structured_content = f"Slide {slide_number}"
    if potential_title:
        structured_content += f": {potential_title}"
    
    structured_content += "\n\n"
    
    # Add text content
    if text_content:
        structured_content += f"Text Content:\n{text_content}\n\n"
    
    # Add image content
    if image_content:
        structured_content += f"Image/Visual Content:\n{image_content}\n\n"
    
    return structured_content.strip()
```

### 📊 **Enhanced GPT-4 Analysis**

#### **Improved Prompt Engineering**
```python
def create_slide_analysis_prompt(slide_number: int, slide_text: str) -> str:
    """Enhanced prompt for better GPT-4 analysis"""
    return f"""
You are a venture capital analyst reviewing a startup pitch deck.

Here is the structured content from slide {slide_number}:

--- SLIDE CONTENT START ---
{slide_text}
--- SLIDE CONTENT END ---

Analyze this slide and extract any relevant information about the startup's:

1. **Problem** - What problem is the startup solving?
2. **Solution** - How does the startup solve this problem?
3. **Product** - What is the product/service offering?
4. **Business Model** - How does the startup make money?
5. **Traction** - What are the key metrics and growth indicators?
6. **Funding** - What funding is being sought or has been raised?
7. **Team** - Information about founders and key team members
8. **Market** - Market size, opportunity, and target market
9. **Competition** - Competitive landscape and positioning
10. **Financials** - Revenue, projections, or financial metrics
11. **Growth Strategy** - Go-to-market strategy and expansion plans
12. **Vision** - Long-term vision and goals

Pay special attention to:
- Numbers and metrics (users, revenue, market size, funding amounts)
- Visual content like charts, graphs, and diagrams
- Slide titles and headers that indicate the topic
- Bullet points and key messaging

Return structured JSON with extracted sections.
